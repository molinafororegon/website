# Welcome!

Welcome to our campaign website built using Jekyll, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for creating blazing fast websites. For detailed instructions on getting started on Jekyll, [read this](https://jekyllrb.com/). We also use the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

## Contributing

Want to contribute to our campaign website? Create an issue, be as detailed as possible, and our team will work with you on implementation. Or create a pull request. 

### Running the site locally
Jekyll comes with a live-reload feature so you can view your work without having to re-lauch. It's not the best live-reload feature and you might have to refresh a couple times for your modifications to catch up.

1. `cd` to your local repo
2. In the root file, run `jekyll serve`
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/`

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

## Notes

The branch landingPage is incomplete and looking for contributors! 

### landingPage To-dos:
- Page content scrolls on top of overlay menu. The desired behavior is for the overlay menu to take up the entirety of the viewport, with no scrolling
- Close button disappears on the menu overlay. 
- Molina For Oregon logo needs to be removed from the navigation bar (top left) on the landing page _only_.
- Menu overlay needs to be appiled to all pages. Some styles will need to be adjusted so that the hamburger button and the close button are visible on those pages.
- David would like the blog posts to have a preview image. Consider [Material UI's Media Card Component](https://material-ui.com/demos/cards/) as an example.
