DAVID MOLINA FOR OREGON CAMPAIGN | Tuesday, September 19, 2017

FOREST GROVE, Ore. – David Molina, 38, former Army Captain, small business owner and founder of a national veterans nonprofit startup announced his candidacy as Republican for Oregon House of Representatives District 29 today. David has a passion to use his 13 years of military, business, tech and startup experience in leadership and job creation to better serve the citizens of Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro, Oregon.

<h1 align="center">“I pledge to use all my skills acquired from years as a citizen-soldier, and as an entrepreneur to expand and open new economic & educational opportunities to improve the lives of House District 29.”</h1>

David understands that in order for the people of District 29 to thrive, we need to limit growth in state spending, provide incentives for small businesses to thrive, accelerate vocational training to create new pathways to the middle class, increase transparency in government, and remove bureaucratic red tape.

“Government servants in Salem should be in the business of streamlining government for all its citizens and promoting an atmosphere for employers to expand in Oregon and new ones to be created,” said Molina.

David's humble upbringing and recent experience growing a family business gives him distinctive insights to the challenges facing rural communities and will fight for their voice to be heard in Salem. “As a farm worker, construction hand, Army enlisted & officer, and entrepreneur, I've been blessed beyond what I deserve and I'd be honored to create lasting prosperity for our communities,” Molina said.

<h1 align="center">I’ll fight for the very best ideas that move Oregon forward and turn our state around.”</h1>

Born in Hood River and growing up in a rural farm town an hour north of Seattle, David was educated at Oregon State University where after 9/11 enrolled in Army ROTC and earned both an Officer Commission in Infantry and bachelor’s degree in Political Science. He has been married for 13 years to his wife, Edith, and together have three daughters.
