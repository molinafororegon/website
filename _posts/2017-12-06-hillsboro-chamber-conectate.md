HILLSBORO, Ore. â€“ This morning on a freezing Washington County morning, over two dozen Latino small business owners and entrepreneurs huddled together to network, connect, and learn strategies to grow their businesses. Hillsboro Chamber Latino Program Specialist, Claudia Cardenas, welcomed everyone and shared the groups' 2017 progress and asked for each individual to share one goal for the following year.  Prior to final end, Claudia announced to the participating chamber members the candidacy of David Molina for House District 29, which encompasses Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro. Fluent in Spanish, David addressed everyone.

<h1 align="center">"David shared his vision of lowering the personal income tax so that small business owners can keep and invest more of what they earn. He spoke about the need to expedite training and preparing Oregon's youth to a variety of industry trades and creating an environment for businesses to thrive and hire."</h1>

Taking time to answer a wide variety of 1-on-1 questions, ranging from lowering taxes to resolving highway 26 traffic, David emphasized the need to elect innovators to public office and fight for creating a healthy business environment in Oregon for entrepreneurs and independent contractors to expand and grow.
