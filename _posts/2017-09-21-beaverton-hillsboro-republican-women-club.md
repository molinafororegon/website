PORTLAND, Ore. â€“ This evening, David Molina, Republican candidate for the Oregon House of Representatives, District 29, gave his first stump speech about his run for public office before an audience of strong conservative women, elected officials, candidates for public office, Republican PCPs, and business owners.

<h1 align="center">"When I couldn't use my New GI Bill to go to a vocational school to train for a new career I self-taught myself to code, launched a veterans nonprofit, and lobbied Congress to prioritize veterans transition and education. I have zero tolerance for status quo and inefficiencies which is why I'm running."</h1>

David spoke about his humble upbringing in the fields and agriculture, working in the spinach fields at a young age, dropping out of high school then returning, raising his right hand to defend all enemies foreign and domestic, starting and struggling to expand his business despite major government bureaucracy, and ensuring his daughters have a bright future and not burdened by state debt. He joined Secretary of State Dennis Richardson, and other distinguished guests and Republican candidates for public office.
