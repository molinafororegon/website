ST HELENS, Ore. - This evening former Army Captain and entrepreneur David Molina, candidate for Oregon House District 29, made some remarks at the Columbia County Republican Party America First Dinner & Auction at the St Helens Elks Lodge. David spoke about the need to "Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way," and how he chose to lead when career politicians failed to expedite educational access to veterans. David closed his remarks shining light on how Salem career politicians and state bureaucrats have lost their way with small business owners, raising fees and taxes at every turn, and why it's imperative we send a small business owner from District 29 to Salem to stand up to these relentless attacks from the far left.
