FOREST GROVE, Ore. - This evening community members gathered to hear Republican candidates running for public office state, county, district and house seats. David Molina spoke 3rd in line on why he’s running, why it’s important to vote, and the repercussions if we don’t bring checks and balances to the Oregon Legislature.

The evening closed with Second Amendment updates from lawmakers on how restrictive the government is becoming to carry a firearm to protect themselves, their families, their friends, our nation, and our Constitution.
