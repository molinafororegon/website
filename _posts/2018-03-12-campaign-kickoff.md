DAVID MOLINA FOR OREGON CAMPAIGN | Monday, March 12, 2018

CORNELIUS, Ore. – Friends, family and voters are invited to meet David Molina, candidate for House District 29 (Forest Grove, Cornelius and West Hillsboro) at the Campaign Kickoff scheduled for Wednesday, March 28, 2018 starting at 6:00 pm at former Cornelius Mayor Neil Knight's barn. Folks will have an opportunity to meet the Republican candidate in-person, why he's running and why he's the best qualified person for the job to represent the district.

<h1 align="center">“Like many voters in the district, David is tired of one-sided Democratic rule, unproductive fighting, and lack of moral leadership in Salem. The Democratic-controlled Oregon legislature and the Governor has wasted untold hours, hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money, from a website that never deployed to a bridge that never got built, to disenfranchising voters by taking funding from veterans. This has got to stop.”</h1>

David has the tenacity and work ethic to take on Portland's Democrats and their number one Susan McLain who are haphazardly moving bills forward that are contrary to Oregonians' beliefs or worse stalling on important transportation priorities that put people to work and save lives. More so, the gravity of Oregon's budget crisis requires bold leadership that can withstand harsh pressures from all sides to shrink state spending, limit government growth, and address the unfunded PERS pension system that is ever taking monies for our kids in public schools, roads, highways and bridges.

<h1 align="center">David raised his right hand and served his country, and in that spirit brings the integrity, leadership, vision, and tenacity learned in our nation's Army to fight in the Oregon House of Representatives for common sense policies that ensure our state's prosperity and security, increase government transparency, and again give voters in the heart of Washington County a reason to be proud of their leaders.”</h1>

_Suggested contribution (payable to David Molina for Oregon) starts at $50 to help him win-every contribution counts. To reserve your spot, please RSVP w/ Natalie Offenbecher at, Natalie@PromoteOregon.gop or by calling (916) 365-5762. Yard signs will be available._
