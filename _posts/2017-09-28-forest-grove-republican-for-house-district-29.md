FOREST GROVE, Ore. â€“ Eight months before the May primary election, Forest Grove resident David Molina, a Republican, has announced his candidacy for Oregon House District 29, now held by state Rep. Susan McLain, a Democrat.

<h1 align="center">Molina, 38, describes himself as an ex-Army Captain, small business owner and founder of a national veterans nonprofit startup.</h1>

According to Molina's <a href="https://www.molinafororegon.com/david-molina-announces-candidacy/">press release</a>, he wants to limit growth in state spending, provide incentives for small businesses, improve vocational training, increase government transparency and remove bureaucratic red tape.

The release states Molina was born in Hood River, grew up in a rural farm town north of Seattle and got a bachelor's degree in political science from Oregon State University, where he enrolled in Army ROTC after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He and his wife, Edith, have three daughters.
