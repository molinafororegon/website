BEND, Ore. – Over the weekend, hundreds of conservative Oregonians representing every county in the state converged onto central Oregon to conduct the state's business, including the Republican platform, network and connect, and share ideas for good governance. State Party Chair, Bill Currier, asked David Molina, Republican candidate for House District 29 to lead everyone in the Pledge of Allegiance. No one took a knee, everyone stood up, participated, and faced Old Glory.

<h1 align="center">"On stage, David asked everyone to standup and give a resounding 'Hooah' before taking the liberty to acknowledge a very special Army Drill Sergeant, Command Sergeant Howard Bella, to standup and be recognized. Retired Command Sergeant Bella, then a 104th Division 1st Sgt. was David's drill sergeant over a decade ago and was participating from his home town of Salem, Oregon."</h1>

During the weekend convention, David participated in the good governance, and military veterans planks, and successfully added another principle of, "ensuring veterans have access to technical training for the jobs of today and the future."
