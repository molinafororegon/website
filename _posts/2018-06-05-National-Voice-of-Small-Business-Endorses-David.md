FOREST GROVE, Ore. - Today, David Molina, candidate for House District 29 was endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business, the voice of small business that advocates on behalf of America's small and independent business owners, both in Washington, D.C., and each state in the union. "I look forward to working with NFIB, entrepreneurs and main street small businesses all across Washington County and Oregon to ensure they have a seat at the table in Salem in 2019, and work to remove bloated red tape, cumbersome paperwork, lessen tax burdens, and invest in them so they don't just survive, but thrive in Oregon," said David Molina, candidate for House District 29. "We need to ensure Oregon is a welcome place for family owned small businesses that create wealth, invest in our communities, and create good jobs for members of the community."

According to Alan Brown, a small-business owner, NFIB Oregon PAC chairman, and former state representative, â€œHeading into the 2019 legislative session, we need as many pro-small business lawmakers as possible in the Oregon Legislature. These candidates have demonstrated both an understanding of the key issues facing small businesses in Oregon and an ability to win in November."
