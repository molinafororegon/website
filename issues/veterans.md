<h3>Preserving our Promise</h3>
<p>Oregon should be first in the nation in terms of protecting and providing for our veterans. In 2016, the voters voted 84/16 to devote 1.5% of the lottery fund to support veterans. This past year, Democratic legislators and the Governor slashed the funding that Oregon voters just approved. Our veterans deserve better. I’ll stand strong for those who served our country.</p>

<h3>Expanding Job Training and Education for Veterans</h3>
<p>After leaving the military, I was shocked to find out that I would be excluded from computer coding schools due to the limitations of the GI Bill. I not only taught myself how to code, but have also been a champion for expanding access to career and technical programs so that other service men and women don’t have to face the same hurdles I did. Veterans need good jobs in lucrative industries to support their families and it is unfair to exclude them from great opportunities in technology-driven fields.</p>

<h3>Creating A Veterans Trust Fund</h3>
<p>It was disappointing to see our government take away essential funding for veterans after voters approved it. I want to establish a Veterans Trust Fund that ensures resources intended for veterans cannot be misused or misdirected in the future. Our veterans shouldn’t have to suffer just because politicians don’t know how to control their spending.</p>
